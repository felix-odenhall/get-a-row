# Get A Row

A web application I developed and designed based on a FIFA Bingo game I came up with. 
It has been created using React, TypeScript and Chakra UI, as well as Cypress and Jest for end-to-end and unit tests.

## The Aim of the Game

Create a username and select 9 tasks you want to complete. The tasks will be shuffled and a bingo board with your selected tasks will be created. The goal is to get three completed tasks in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

The idea is to pick tasks you believe you can achieve in one or multiple games of FIFA. Eg: Score a header, win by 4 goals etc.
